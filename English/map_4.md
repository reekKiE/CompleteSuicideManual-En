In addition, the first three people were all members of a group of delinquents who formed a Bōsōzoku (Japanese biker gang) a year ago. The motive for all members' suicides is completely unknown.

## Place of death

The population is said to be less than 40,000, but Kumatori is not a rural town. There is a large bus station building in front of the station, and the commercial street is frequently visited by pedestrians. However, if you take a taxi from the station at the west end of the town and drive east along National Route 170 for ten minutes, you will see the existing rural land on the right. Around here, five people committed suicide. Get out and walk around here. There are woods and farm huts everywhere. The place of suicide is your choice.

Check the place of death of the serial suicide beforehand. It may be a good idea to remember the old friend and think of dying serially. The onion hut and small warehouse where Mr. A and Mr. B committed suicide have been demolished. The chestnut tree where Mr. D hanged himself has also been cut down. Only the farm work hut where Mr. C hanged himself is still there. Summer is also a bit spooky, and a hut with a few beams on the roof is the best place to commit suicide. The location of the suicide scene is shown in Figure 2.

## Suicide method

If you want to commit suicide in this town, there is no other option but to hang yourself. When hanging, it is better to use a rope to suit the surrounding atmosphere. It is also interesting to tie yourself behind your back and hang yourself, then lower the rope from a high place to imitate the mystery of serial suicides.[^kumatori-tie-behind] Perhaps the theory of homicide would rise again in the local area, and maybe you have become a prominent figure in the public media. It is best to not leave a suicide note, to enhance the mystery.

[^kumatori-tie-behind]: The fifth death in the series was Mr. T, a member of the Bosozoku, and friend of Mr. K (the fourth death). He asked for leave from the company saying that he "had to attend a friend's funeral" and was granted two days of leave. However, although he rushed back to Kumatori two days after K's death, he was unable to make it to the funeral. Then, he died at a friend's home. His hands were tied behind his back with plastic knots, and he died of hanging. Nearby residents did not hear any suspicious noises. There were no signs of a fight at the scene. Judging from the knotted rope, it could have been done by the deceased himself after hanging, so the police classified the case as suicide.
