# Postscript

In the preface, I wrote an exaggerated opening manifesto about "modern society and suicide". I admit it is a bit exaggerated.

The original reason for writing this book was just because I was tired of the idea that "you shouldn't ever commit suicide", which I couldn't think of any basis for, yet it was so naively accepted by the public.

It can be seen everywhere that primary school teachers use "The Importance of Life" as a topic to ask students to write essays; people who commit suicide are casually said to have weak willpower, etc. A society where people can easily say "you must live on with strength" is not only so claustrophobic that it makes people unable to breathe, but also makes life miserable. Therefore, let this book circulate, creating the choice of "you can also seek death as a last resort", and hope to open a vent in the closed and terminal iron house of society, to let fresh air in and make life easier. This is my true goal.

I'm not proposing some boring idea as "Let's all commit suicide!". If you want to live, you must live with ease, and if you want to die, you must die with ease. That's how life should be, to live and die as you wish. (Case 9)

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Misa Ochiai (落合美砂) for editing, Seiichi Suzuki (鈴木成一) for art design, and Kazunori Sadahiro (サダヒロ カズノリ) for illustration.
